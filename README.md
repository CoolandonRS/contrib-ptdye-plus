### Ptdye Plus

Introducing a Java mod designed exclusively for the [Create: Prepare to Dye](https://modrinth.com/modpack/create-prepare-to-dye) (CPTD) modpack!

This mod includes code for features and bug fixes not achievable with KubeJS, the JavaScript framework used by the CPTD team.

Keep in mind that this mod is primarily tested for use within the CPTD modpack, and using it elsewhere may lead to unexpected behavior.

Key Features:

- Command to access the stonecutter GUI: /openStonecutter
  - By using the "/openStonecutter" command, players can directly access the stonecutter's GUI, making it more convenient to craft devices.


While the mod currently focuses on this stonecutter enhancement, expect future updates for more features to enhance your gameplay. Stay tuned!
